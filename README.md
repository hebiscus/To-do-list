~- on lower resolution everything collapses~ / 06.05/2023 now better (not fully responsive, but desktop taken care of)

~- css units could be used better~ / 06.05.2023 changed up font units and css grid units

~- highligh which "tab" is currently in use (all tasks, today's tasks, week tasks or completed tasks)~ 07.05.2023 now working!
